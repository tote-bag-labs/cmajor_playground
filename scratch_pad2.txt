Sampling????????


when you record digital audio you go from continuous to discrete time.

audio signal (analog) ->  ADC -> digital signal (samples)


What does the ADC do?

every n time, what is the signal level?

sample rate: the signal was measured n times a second

44.1kHz -> sample rate


Nyquist-Shannon Theorem

you can't represent signals above Fs / 2 in a discrete system.

aliasing!


basic downsample (decimation)

downsample ratio = Fs / Fs'


input buffer
ouput buffer


// decimator
for(int i = 0; i < numsamples; ++i)
{
    if(i % downsampleRatio)
    {
        outputBuffer[i] = inputBuffer[i];
    }
    else
    {
        outputBuffer[i] = 0;
    }
}



// zero order hold

currentSample = 0; // state

for(int i = 0; i < numsamples; ++i)
{
    if(i % downsampleRatio)
    {
        currentSample = inputBuffer[i];
    }
    
    outputBuffer[i] = currentSample;
}

Upsample -> multiply by BLIT -> Downsample

What is a BLIT and how do I make one?





BLIT mblitOsc;

downSampleRateChanged(double newSampleRate)
{
    mblitOsc.setFrequency(newSampleRate);
}

downsample(float* input, float* output)
{
    for(int i = 0; i < numsamples; ++i)
    {
        output[i] = input[i] * mblitOsc.getSample();
    }
}
